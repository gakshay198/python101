# python101
Learning python and documenting it. Learning it through "Learning Python3 The Hard Way".

I have tried to explain the stuff in comments as much as I could. Feel free to modify.


The ex.py generally have many of the study drills completed in them and not in other files. The files are modified many times randomly once they are created according to the exercise in the book.
Whenever I learned things on the go I modified the related files as much as I could.
